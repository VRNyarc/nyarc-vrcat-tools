## v0.1.6 (2025-10-27) - Advanced Shape Key Transfer & Post-Processing

### ‚ú® Major New Features
* **Advanced Surface Deform Controls** - Fine-tune transfer quality with strength and falloff parameters
  * Strength slider (0.0-1.0) controls transfer intensity
  * Falloff distance (0.1-16.0) for smoother transitions on clothing edges
* **Boundary Smoothing System** - Professional post-processing workflow for hard cutoff lines
  * Automatic vertex group mask generation for boundary vertices
  * Configurable smoothing iterations and boundary width
  * Auto-blur mask option for softer transitions
  * Weight Paint mode integration for manual mask editing
* **Partial Island Handling (WIP)** - Experimental handling for small mesh details (buttons, patches, belts)
  * EXCLUDE mode: Reset partially moved islands to basis
  * AVERAGE mode: Apply uniform displacement to entire island
  * Configurable island size threshold
  * *Note: This feature is still work-in-progress and may need further refinement*
* **Pre-processing Options** - Modify source mesh before transfer (non-destructive)
  * Subdivision support (simple or Catmull-Clark)
  * Displace modifier with configurable strength and direction
  * All pre-processing works on temporary copy, original mesh unchanged
* **Companion Smoothing Tool** - Dedicated panel for post-transfer smoothing workflow
  * Apply smoothing to existing shape keys using vertex group masks
  * Generate/regenerate smoothing masks after transfer
  * Manual smoothing control for iterative refinement

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes
* **Fixed Triangulation Modifier Bug** - Triangulation modifiers are now properly removed instead of being permanently applied
  * Previously, compatibility triangulation was being baked into the mesh
  * Now correctly cleans up temporary modifiers after transfer
* **Viewport Selection Fallback** - Transfer now works with viewport-selected mesh when no target is set in UI
* **Better Modifier Cleanup** - All temporary modifiers (triangulation, edge split) properly removed after transfer

### üé® UI/UX Improvements
* **Advanced Options Panel** - Collapsible section for advanced parameters
  * Surface Deform strength and falloff controls
  * Post-processing options (smoothing, island handling)
  * Pre-processing options (subdivision, displace)
* **Expanded Help Documentation** - Detailed tooltips and help text for all new features
* **Skip Existing Option** - Skip transfer if shape key already exists on target

### üîß Technical Improvements
* Modular post-processing utilities (`smooth_boundary.py`, `preprocessing.py`)
* Better error handling and recovery for modifier operations
* Improved mesh validation and compatibility preparation
* Enhanced debug output for troubleshooting
